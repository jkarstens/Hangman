Hangman
=======

Use the keyboard to guess letters and words to play Hangman against the computer on three difficulties. The computer chooses words from a file at random or of a specified length.

WordFileManager.java deals with reading the word files, and Hangman.java is the applet that displays the game and lets the player interact.
